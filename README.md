# satellite-imagery-to-maps

### *** Work in progress ***
<br/><br/>
I'm developing an automated pipeline that creates maps from satellite imagery and aerial sensor data using a CycleGAN (Generative Adversarial Network). I use a public [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/alincijov/pix2pix-maps) consisting of paired satellite images and street map representations.
